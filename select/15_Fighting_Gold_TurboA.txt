You can feel it weighing you down
Heavy chains of fate are tightly bound
Shackling your hopes and your brightest dreams

Struggling with every breath you take Knowing you could never run away
You are more resilient than you seem

And when the wind starts to blow out of control
Everything just falls apart all around
Pick up the broken pieces You'll find a shard of hope is
Waiting to reshape the world with your hands!

FIGHTING GOLD!
Only the ones who believe And keep alive the flames of passion
Burning in their hearts
IGNITE THE WORLD!
Shine 'til your life burns away
Though the odds are stacked against you
Neither Lords nor Kings could stop you
A brilliant and indomitable soul,
FIGHTING GOLD!

Don't need freedom, don't need salvation
Keep your prayers and your revelations
Your heart is all you need to understand

As we slowly crawl across the Earth
You are standing tall and looking forward
Reach out and hold the stars in your hands

The wind continues to blow out of control
Pushing you towards an uncertain future
Embrace the chains that bind you
Move forward and you'll find you
Can't be held down or deterred from the path!

FIGHTING GOLD!
Only the ones who can see
The crimson hue of passion and can
Wield it in their hands
REPAINT THE WORLD!
Pour it over everything
All your anger and your hatred
All the ideals you hold sacred
Paint it over with a Justice of your own
FIGHTING GOLD!

Turn your back on peace
And know there's no turning back

FIGHTING GOLD!
Only the ones who believe
And keep alive the flames of passion
Burning in their hearts
IGNITE THE WORLD!
Shine 'til your life burns away
Though the odds are stacked against you
Neither Lords nor Kings can stop you
A brilliant and indomitable soul
FIGHTING GOLD!
